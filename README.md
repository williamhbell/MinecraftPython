Minecraft programming with Python
=================================

A short Python programming course for primary children written by W. H. Bell [ http://www.whbell.net/ ].  The 
examples are aimed at children from age 10 to 11, where P7 is the last primary school year in Scottish schools.

The idea of the course is to follow the activity sheets given in the doc/ directory, working through each of 
the examples and challenges in order.  The challenges can be solved by starting from the working example 
files and then modifying them.

The "Full Programming Resource Pack" from [ http://www.geocraft.org.uk/teaching-and-learning-resources/snowdon-minecraft-geography ] contains 
quick start instructions for Python programming with Minecraft and a reference sheet for the different blocks.
